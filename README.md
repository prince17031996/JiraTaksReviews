# JiraTaksReviews
Automating the Review process of Jira (User Story , Testscript , Bugs)

# Project Overview

This project utilizes Python, Selenium, and the pytest unit testing framework, following the Page Object Model design pattern. It includes the creation of various utilities aimed at streamlining the testing process.

## Description

The purpose of this automation tool is to facilitate the review process of User Stories, specifically focusing on Definition of Ready (DOR) and Definition of Done (DOD) checks Test Scripts , Bugs . During the review, it is essential to verify that all related fileds   are up-to-date. However, this task can be time-consuming, especially when dealing with a large volume of User Stories, Test Script or Bugs .

To address this challenge, I have developed an automated solution that systematically checks various Locators to determine whether the necessary fields are updated. If discrepancies are found, the tool will log these issues either in an Excel file or within the comments section of the relevant Id.
